# minishell
Stripped-down copy of bash. Supports buildins(cd, pwd, echo, env, export), executes binaries(ls, wc, cat...), supports pipes, redirects (>, >>, &lt;, &lt;&lt;) and signals ctrl+d, ctrl+c, ctrl+\. 2 people worked on this project in a team.
My part was executable and my teamemate's part was parsing of terminal input string.
To launch minishell, write "make" command and then write "./minishell" command in the directory, where Makefile is located.
Full subject of the project is in subject.en.pdf
